                My client is Lauren Chang, a friend of mine, who is a Graphic Design Major at James Madison University. She had already made a mock up of an art portfolio website in Adobe for one of her classes, so I just took inspiration from that and implemented it
                for this project.
            </li>
            <li>
                All of the designs, icons, GIFs, and illustrations were designed by Lauren. The only use of third party images were the Instagram and Linkedin icons on the CONTACT page. Those icons are from flaticon and are free of use as long as credit is given to them,
                which I included in the footer of this website.
            </li>
            <li>
                Six pages were created for this website including the homepage, illustrations portfolio, designs portfolio, commission page, about page, and contact page.
            </li>
            <li>
                Each page has the consistent header displaying Lauren's name with her Graphic Designer tagline.
            </li>
            <li>
                Each page has access to a navigation bar that is adaptable to smaller screens.
            </li>
            <li>
                Each page is adaptable for larger and smaller screens by exhibiting a horizontal, landscape design for larger screens and vertical design for smaller screens.
            </li>
            <li>
                This website exhibits a coherent style. It uses a simple color scheme of a rosey pink color, a tan color, a white color, and a dark chocolate brown color. The use of outline boxes, titles resting on the outlines, and transparency was also used throughout.
                All of the coherent styles were placed in main.css. All of the other pages have their own individual stylesheets.
            </li>
            <li>
                All images have a declared alt tag that describes the photo.
            </li>
            <li>
                Every page uses the same diamond icon as its favicon. This is the same icon Lauren uses as her logo.
            </li>
            <li>
                All of the files are placed in its appropriate folder or location.
            </li>
            <li>
                No libraries were used to create this website.
            </li>
            <li>
                Every HTML and CSS file was validated and approved by W3C's Nu Validation.
            </li>
            <li>
                All pages were neatly aligned.
            </li>
            <li>
                Two fonts were used throughout this website. They were Lato, as the sans font, and Playfair Display, as the sans-serif font.
            </li>
            <li>
                An email contact form was included in the CONTACT page.
            </li>
            <li>
                This website has external links to three website including Lauren's RedBubble account, art Instagram account, and Linkedin account.
            </li>
            <li>
                Each class and id label were declared appropriately. If classes or ids weren't used, then different types of selectors were used to target the elements in CSS.
            </li>
            <li>
                Several animations were implemented in this website including a slideshow of reviews on the COMMISSION page and a slide out navigation bar that appears on smaller screens.
            </li>
            <li>

                All files are completely lowercase. All HTML, CSS, and JS files also follow the "kabob" naming convention.

                I've been steadily working on this project ever since it was assigned (mainly because I was really excited about it), so I believe that I have a good, steady flow of commits.
